# Todo

A simple Todo app made with React[^react] + Vite[^vite] and is running at https://todo.husjon.io

It requires no account to use and stores all the data in the users Browser using localStorage[^localStorage].  
The limitation of this is of course that the data cannot be transfered betwee devices.
